- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mmodestas

- ðŸ‘€ During day, I am Oracle ERP consultant. During nigth, I am home automation enthusiast. Two years ago I started automating my house with Home Assistant and this became my hobby.
There are not that many options for open source, configurable and reasonable priced home automation gadgets so I started making them myself.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning... a lot. Python, YAML, Programming microcontrolers with Arduino, designing custom PCB's for my projects, discovering 3D printing.. And everything else that is related to tikering my and my friends houses :). 

- ðŸ“« You can reach me by email: mmodestas@gmail.com
